# **Cost And Usage Governance**

This lab is provided as part of **[AWS Innovate For Every Application Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/events/aws-innovate/apj/for-every-app/)**

Click [here](https://github.com/phonghuule/aws-innovate-fea-2022) to explore the full list of hands-on labs.

ℹ️ You will run this lab in your own AWS account. Please follow directions at the end of the lab to remove resources to avoid future costs.

## Introduction
 This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to implement cost and usage governance. The skills you learn will help you control your cost and usage in alignment with your business requirements.

## Goals
- Implement IAM Policies to control usage

## Costs
- A small number of instances will be started & then immediately terminated
- Costs will be less than $5 if all steps including the teardown are performed

## Time to complete
- The lab should take approximately 30 minutes to complete

## Create a group of users for testing
This lab requires you to develop a restrictive IAM policy, then apply the policies to a group of users, then login as a user in that group and verify the policy. We will create this test group.

1. Go to the **IAM** service page:

## Create an IAM Policy to restrict service usage by region
To manage costs you need to manage and control your usage. AWS offers multiple regions, so depending on your business requirements you can limit access to AWS services depending on the region. This can be used to ensure usage is only allowed in specific regions which are more cost effective, and minimize associated usage and cost, such as data transfer.

We will create a policy that allows all EC2, RDS and S3 access in a single region only. 
NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.

### Create the Region restrictive IAM Policy
1. Go to the **IAM** service page:
![Images/AWSPolicy1.png](/Images/AWSPolicy1.png)

```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:*",
                    "rds:*",
                    "s3:*"
                ],
                "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"}}
            }
        ]
    }

13. Log out of the console as TestUser1.

You have successfully implemented an IAM policy that restricts all EC2, RDS and S3 operations to a single region. You have also successfully launched a **c5 Instance Type**.

## Create an IAM Policy to restrict EC2 usage by family
AWS offers different instance families within EC2. Depending on your workload requirements - different types will be most cost effective. For non-specific environments such as testing or development, you can restrict the instance families in those accounts to the most cost effective generic types. It is also an effective way to increase Savings Plan or Reserved Instance utilization, by ensuring these accounts will consume any available commitment discounts.

We will create a policy that allows operations on specific instance families only. This will not only restrict launching an instance, but all other activities. 
NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.

## Extend an IAM Policy to restrict EC2 usage by instance size
We can also restrict the size of instance that can be launched. This can be used to ensure only low cost instances can be created within an account. This is ideal for testing and development, where high capacity instances may not be required. We will extend the EC2 family policy above, and add restrictions by adding the sizes of instances allowed.

## Create an IAM policy to restrict EBS Volume creation by volume type
Extending cost optimization governance beyond compute instances will ensure overall higher levels of cost optimization. Similar to EC2 instances, there are different storage types. Governing the type of storage that can be created in an account can be effective to minimize cost.

We will create an IAM policy that denies operations that contain provisioned IOPS (io1) EBS volume types. This will not only restrict creating a volume, but all other actions that attempt to use this volume type. 

NOTE: it is best practice to provide only the minimum access required, the policy used here is for brevity and simplicity, and should only be implemented as a demonstration before being removed.

5. Copy and paste the policy into the console:
```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Action": "ec2:*",
                "Resource": "*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "ec2:VolumeType": "io1"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
```
